=head1 NAME

countdown -- like sleep only displays the amount of time remaining.

=head1 USAGE

    countdown [number of seconds]
    countdown [minutes]m
    countdown [hours]h
    countdown [seconds]s

    --man - displays the man page.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<countdown> waits for a certain time to pass, in a similar fashion to the
UNIX sleep command, but unlike sleep, it displays the amount of time left to
sleep. I always found it frustrating that I've placed an alarm using
C<sleep $secs ; finish-client> and could not tell how much time left, so I
wrote B<countdown> for that.
